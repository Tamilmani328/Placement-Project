    <h2>1.Hamas Approves Gaza Ceasefire Proposal
       Hamas has endorsed a new ceasefire plan mediated by Egypt and Qatar. The proposal includes a 60-day truce, the release of hostages, and prisoner exchanges. It comes during a devastating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where more than 62,000 Palestinians have perished. Protests raging in Israel—drawing around 400,000 participants—target Prime Minister Netanyahu over stalled negotiations. Further, the UK is accelerating efforts to evacuate injured Gazan children for treatment, while global pressure is mounting for sanctions and cessation of the conflict.
